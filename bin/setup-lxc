# Set up Linux Containers (LXC)
#
# If you don't run Linux, you better look at Vagrant to set up virtual machines.
#
# But if you run Linux anyway then you can use LXC to run virtual machines on
# the same kernel instead of creating a full virtual machine.
#
# Installation in Debian:
#
#   sudo apt install lxd
#   sudo lxd init
#   sudo usermod -aG lxd "$USER"
#   # Restart your user's session to gain the new group privilege.
#
# You may also like to look at Lexi to manage your LXC containers:

set -e

lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 ofn-dev

# The launch can take some time.
while ! lxc exec ofn-dev -- sh -c 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub; do

# Allow connection via SSH.
# Your config could look like this:
# ```
# Host ofn-dev.lxc
#   HostName 127.0.0.1
#   Port 1122
#   User root
#   UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
#   StrictHostKeyChecking no
#   PasswordAuthentication no
#   LogLevel FATAL
# ```
lxc config device add ofn-dev myport1122 proxy listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:1122 connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:22
